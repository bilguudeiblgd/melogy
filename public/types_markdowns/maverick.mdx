# “MVRK”

**Brief Description:**

The MVRK marches to the beat of their own drum, with zero tolerance for following the crowd or bending to anyone else's rules. If it's forbidden, they're in. Confident, daring, and fiercely independent, they thrive on breaking boundaries and pushing limits—whether it's rules, expectations, or just norms in general. They might be trouble, but they're also loyal to a fault.

**Warning Label**

MVRKs are often hiding a fear of vulnerability behind their rebellious nature. Beneath all that "don't care" attitude, they worry about being seen as weak or not enough, which makes them throw up walls. Real talk? They're more afraid of being controlled or judged than they let on.

**Green & Red Flags**

- **Green Flags:** MVRKs need someone who doesn't try to control them and can go toe-to-toe with their boldness. They're drawn to partners who are as open-minded and independent as they are—people who can keep up with their wild streak without trying to rein them in.
- **Red Flags:** They struggle with partners who are overly cautious or need a lot of structure. Attempts to "fix" them, restrict them, or impose too many rules will have them running for the hills.
