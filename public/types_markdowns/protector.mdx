# “PRTC” (Activist/The righteous one)

**Brief Description:**

The PRTC is the voice for justice in every group. They’re the friend who won’t stay silent in the face of unfairness and will stand up for others no matter the cost. They believe in change, pushing others to see beyond themselves and join them in the fight for a better world. They’re intense, protective, and driven, but beneath it all, they wrestle with frustration when progress is slow or the world feels indifferent.

**Warning Label**

PRTCs often feel personally responsible for every injustice they see, which can lead to burnout and self-doubt. Their passion for change sometimes leaves them feeling isolated and misunderstood, especially when they’re faced with apathy or resistance from others.

**Green & Red Flags**

- **Green Flags:** PRTCs need a partner who respects their passion and supports their activism, but also knows how to ground them when they’re overwhelmed. They do best with someone who values empathy and integrity, who can listen deeply, and who’s comfortable with standing by their side in the face of opposition.
- **Red Flags:** Apathy and cynicism are deal-breakers for PRTCs. They can quickly lose patience with partners who dismiss their values, show no interest in social issues, or avoid difficult conversations. Their intensity may feel overwhelming to someone who isn’t as invested in making a difference, potentially leading to friction in the relationship.
