# “CPTN”

**Brief Description:**

The CPTN is the friend who keeps everything (and everyone) in check. They're natural leaders who love organizing and planning, guiding the group toward solutions with confidence and authority. But beneath their "I got this" energy, they sometimes feel isolated or overwhelmed, unsure of who's got *their* back when they need it.

**Warning Label**

The CPTN often hides their vulnerability and fear of failure. They may feel like they *have* to be strong and in control, leading them to mask stress and pressure with a calm exterior, rarely showing the weight they carry.

**Green & Red Flags**

- **Green Flags:** The CPTN thrives in relationships with someone who values structure and stability. They are loving partners who create a safe and dependable environment, always looking for ways to improve the relationship and make things smoother for their significant other. They're supportive, driven, and show love by taking care of the practical details.
- **Red Flags:** Their need to "fix" everything can come across as controlling, especially if their partner prefers a more spontaneous or emotional connection. They might struggle to let go and allow their partner to handle things, fearing that they'll lose control. This can lead to tension if their partner needs more freedom or emotional depth, as CPTNs sometimes find it hard to open up and be vulnerable.
