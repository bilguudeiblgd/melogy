# “MPTH” (Therapist/The kind one)

**Brief Description:**

The MPTH is the compassionate friend who’s always there to listen, provide comfort, and understand others’ emotions deeply. They’re the one you call when you need support, validation, or just someone to vent to. But with their open heart comes a tendency to neglect their own emotional needs, often becoming overwhelmed from absorbing everyone else’s problems.

**Green & Red Flags**

- **Green Flags:** MPTHs are incredibly caring partners who create a safe and nurturing space for their loved ones. They are intuitive and compassionate, with a knack for understanding their partner’s unspoken feelings and providing constant reassurance. They tend to remember the little things, making their partners feel deeply valued and cared for.
- **Red Flags:** Their tendency to prioritize others can mean they ignore their own needs, leading to emotional burnout. MPTHs may also avoid confrontation, sweeping issues under the rug to keep the peace, which can create hidden tension. Their strong empathy may lead to over-involvement in their partner's struggles, risking co-dependency if they aren’t careful about setting boundaries.
