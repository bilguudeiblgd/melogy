# “JSTR” (Joker/The funny one)

**Brief Description:**

The JSTR is the group's built-in comedian, always ready with a quick comeback, a bizarre meme reference, or an over-the-top impression. They make light of every situation, keeping things fun and helping people forget their worries. But there's more going on than they let on: the laughs often cover up insecurities or things they'd rather not deal with head-on.

**Warning Label**

JSTRs often use humor to dodge vulnerability. They're pros at making fun of life's issues, but deep down, they worry that people might not take them seriously or see past the laughs. When things get serious, they may pull away to avoid feeling exposed.

**Green & Red Flags**

- **Green Flags:** A JSTR's ideal partner appreciates humor and doesn't take life too seriously. They thrive with someone who can keep up with their jokes and dish out some sarcasm of their own. Partners who value spontaneity, laughter, and an easygoing approach will bring out the best in them.
- **Red Flags:** JSTRs might struggle in relationships that demand constant depth and heavy emotional discussions. They can be uncomfortable with serious, vulnerable moments, which could be frustrating for partners who need open communication and transparency. Sensitivity to their sarcasm or jokes might also lead to friction if their partner takes offense too easily.
