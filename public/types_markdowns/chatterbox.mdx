# “CHTR” (Gossiper/The talkative one)

**Brief Description:**

The CHTR is your go-to person for the latest updates, funniest stories, and anything worth talking about. They live for connecting people through conversations, always keeping things lively with their endless curiosity and humor. But behind the energetic small talk, they sometimes worry if they're actually being heard or if people just think they're annoying.

**Warning Label**

CHTRs worry that their chatter might push people away, leading them to second-guess themselves more than they let on. Beneath the friendly gossip and constant stories, they fear they're not truly connecting with people as much as they hope.

**Green & Red Flags**

- **Green Flags:** The best partner for a CHTR is someone who can handle their high-energy discussions and loves a good story or two. They thrive with someone who's also curious, open-minded, and willing to jump into spontaneous conversations about anything from pop culture to deep life questions.
- **Red Flags:** CHTRs can struggle with partners who need a lot of quiet time or aren't big on sharing every detail. Their love for gossip and connecting might feel overwhelming to someone who values privacy or doesn't care much for small talk. And if their partner gets easily overwhelmed by high energy or feels like boundaries are often crossed, it can create friction.
