# “HSTL”

**Brief Description:**

The HSTL is all about the grind. They set high standards for themselves and everyone around them, believing success comes only through relentless effort. They're the friend who wakes you up for early workouts, motivates you through tough times, and believes in pushing limits. Deep down, they have an intense fear of failure and rarely admit when they feel overwhelmed.

**Warning Label**

HSTLs secretly fear mediocrity. Behind all their drive and tough talk, there's a hidden worry that they'll never reach the top. This leads them to overwork themselves and sometimes ignore their own (and others') emotional needs, fearing that slowing down will make them lose their edge.

**Green & Red Flags**

- **Green Flags:** They work best with partners who are independent, self-motivated, and not easily intimidated by their intensity. They thrive in relationships where both people are driven and can celebrate each other's wins. A partner who values growth and is willing to work through challenges will have the HSTL's respect and admiration.
- **Red Flags:** HSTLs can become impatient or frustrated with partners who lack ambition or are overly laid-back. If their partner doesn't share their work ethic, they may start to feel disconnected. They struggle with vulnerability and can be dismissive of emotional conversations, focusing on "fixing" problems rather than just being present.
