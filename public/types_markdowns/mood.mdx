**Green & Red Flags**

- **Green Flags:** MOODs are loyal, thoughtful partners who thrive on emotional intimacy and connection. They are the ones who remember small details, pay attention to their partner’s emotional needs, and prefer slow, meaningful moments over flashy gestures. Their introspection can create a deep bond, helping their partner feel truly seen and understood.
- **Red Flags:** Their tendency to withdraw when overwhelmed can make their partner feel pushed away or unimportant. MOOD types can become lost in their own feelings, unintentionally neglecting their partner’s need for open communication. Their reclusiveness might also mean they’re hesitant to step out of their comfort zone or take action, especially in situations requiring compromise or social effort.
